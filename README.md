Link Adder - WordPress plugin for simple link adding
====================================================

This is a WordPress plugin that generates a bookmarklet that lets you easily add links to your WordPress Links section while visiting another site. It is good when you want to add a link while surfing the web, but don’t want to log in to WordPress, click Links and Add New and then write the info. With the bookmarklet this plugin generates, you can view a website, click the bookmark and a box pops up with title and URL already filled in. If the info is not correct, or you want it to be something else, you can change it here. The description is optional. When you’re done, just click Add Link, and the box will disappear and the link is added in the background.
